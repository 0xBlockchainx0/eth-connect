## Inspiration

Most of our daily work requires interacting with web3; it is usually a pain in the rear. This project provides a well tested, revisioned version of web3; it was built entirely using Typescript, and modern patterns like `async/await`, getting rid of the strange code patterns introduced by the old days Javascript.

The version we all use of web3 was made three years ago, it was patched several times to fix inconsistencies, but it has no active professional maintenance.

## What it does

Replaces web3.

## Challenges we ran into

Decrypt what the original developers tried to do

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Test coverage, cleaner interface

## What we learned

How many millons of dollars, ether, alt coins are running on this?!

## What's next for web3-ts

Publish and use it!
